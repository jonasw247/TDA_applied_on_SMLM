# Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applied on Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) data
This tutorial enables the use of persistent images as vector representation of structural properties of Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) to make further analysis like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Using: https://github.com/GUDHI/TDA-tutorial

## Getting Started

You'll need at least Python, and Jupyter Notebooks to run the [script](From_SMLM_to_machine_learning-Tutorial.ipynb).

For installing, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
